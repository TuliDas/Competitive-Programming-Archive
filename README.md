# 🧠 Competitive Programming Archive

This repository contains my personal collection of solved problems and practice codes from various online judges. It's a long-term archive of my coding journey, primarily built during my undergraduate and academic
years. Most problems are from beginner to intermediate difficulty, with a few advanced ones. I plan to revisit and solve harder problems in the future to further improve my skills.

## 📚 Contents

The problems are organized by platform in separate folders:

- 📁 `LeetCode Solutions/`       – Practice problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- 📁 `UVA Solutions/`            – Solutions from [UVA Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/)
- 📁 `LightOJ Solutions/`        – Problems solved from [LightOJ](https://lightoj.com/)
- 📁 `Codeforces Solutions/`     – Submissions and contests from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- 📁 `Practice/`                 – General practice problems, algorithm snippets, and templates

Each file typically contains:

- ✅ Problem name & ID  
- 🔗 Link to the problem statement  
- 💬 Short metadata (language, verdict, solved date, etc.)

## 📦 Notes & Tips

- Most problems were solved during academic contests or independent practice.
- Codes are archived mainly for learning, sharing, and future revision.
- I’ve chosen to keep Vjudge-only problems grouped rather than split them by their original platform.
- Feel free to browse or use them for reference!
